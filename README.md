Just another repository

Hi everyone,

I'm wanting to create a website with easily accessible therapeutic tools for people to quickly and effectively overcome their own personal and mental health problems including crushing depression, smashing shyness/anxiety, re-creating relationships with friends/family/others, and relieving habits and addictions.

How would you like to change your life and experience real joy and enlightenment at a cheap price with tools that you can use for the rest of your life? Would you like to learn techniques that make a majority of mental health care obsolete? Here's a good place to start.
